# Displays

## Simple FFI library to show display information with Deno.

This is WIP and just for a project im doing, feel free to use it. 

> (this has only been tested/built on Windows/linux but should work everywhere, can't be bothered to built it for every platform.)

Usage : 
```typescript
import display from "https://github.com/hironichu/displays/mod.ts";

console.log(display);

```
